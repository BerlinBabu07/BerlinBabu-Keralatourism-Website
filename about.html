        <p>Kerala, a state on India's tropical Malabar Coast, has nearly 600km of Arabian Sea shoreline. It's known for its palm-lined beaches and backwaters, a network of canals. Inland are the Western Ghats, mountains whose slopes support tea, coffee and spice plantations as well as wildlife. National parks like Eravikulam and Periyar, plus Wayanad and other sanctuaries, are home to elephants, langur monkeys and tigers.
          <br>
          <br>
        
          Kerala, located on the south-western tip of India, enjoys unique geographical features that have made it one of the most sought-after tourist destinations in Asia. Fondly referred to as ‘God’s Own Country’, Kerala was selected by the National Geographic Traveller as one of the 50 destinations of a lifetime and one of the thirteen paradises in the world.

An equable climate, serene beaches, tranquil stretches of backwaters, lush hill stations and exotic wildlife are the major attractions of this land.  A unique advantage of Kerala is that most of the destinations here are only a two - four hour drive from the other.

Classical art forms, colourful festivals, exotic cuisine are some of the cultural marvels that await travellers. Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine and Panchakarma, the rejuvenation therapy in Ayurveda have also helped Kerala to gain a pan-global reputation as a worth-visit destination.

Season never ends in Kerala, thanks to the year-long moderate climate and numerous festivals and events. <br> <br>

God’s own country will never disappoint you as you won’t experience anything less than paradise. Kerala tourism will surprise you with several options to explore this tropical bliss in different ways. Float along on the backwaters of Alleppey, Periyar and Munnar and experience cloud nine while you take in the gorgeous sights and nature sounds on these backwaters. The best way to explore the backwaters is to sail on a quaint Kerala house boat. For the ones who find serenity in the woods, trek through Wayanad’s lush green jungles. You can join various trekking groups and camp in the green woods under the stars with a group of fellow trekkers.
